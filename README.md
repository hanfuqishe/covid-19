Prevention, treatment, and sequelae treatment about COVID-19

Today is September 7, 2020. 

As of today, the cumulative number of people infected with COVID-19 worldwide has exceeded 27 million, and the number of people who have died of COVID-19 has exceeded 880,000.
Except for China, countries in the world have not found an effective way to treat COVID-19.

Here I will introduce a few to you.

The PPT in this project introduces Tradional Chinese medicine prescriptions with functions of prevention, treatment and sequelae treatment. These prescriptions were developed based on the traditional Chinese Book of Changes(also translated as "I Ching", which has a history of 5000+ years).

Note that they come from another civilization.
Maybe difficult to understand, but easy to verify.

Hope it can help you.
